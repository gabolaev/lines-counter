B - You wanted me, here I am.
J - I wanted to see what you would do and you didn't disappoint you let five people die then you let dent take your place, even to a guy like me, that's cold
B - Where's Dent?
J - Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were but I know the truth. There is no going back, you have changed things, forever.
B - Then why do you wanna kill me?
J - Ha-ha-ha (that laugh) I don't.. I don't wanna kill you, what would I do without you? Go back to ripping off mob dealers? No, no, you...you complete me
B - You are garbage who kills for money
J - Don't talk like one of them. You are not. Even if you would like to be, to them you are just a freak..like me, they need you right now..
But when they don't.. They will cast you out like a leper you see their morals, their code...its a bad joke, dropped at the first sign of trouble, they are only as good as the world allows them to be. I will show you, when chips are down these civilized people...
They will eat each other, see. I am not a monster, I am just ahead of the curve.
